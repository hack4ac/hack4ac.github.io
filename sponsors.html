            <!-- Start of Why -->
            <h2><a href="https://peerj.com/"><img src="images/peerJ_logo_transparent.png" alt="PeerJ" width="100"></a></h2>
            
            <p>PeerJ is an Open Access publisher of scholarly articles. They aim to drive the costs of publishing down, while improving the overall publishing experience, and providing authors with a publication venue suitable for the 21st Century. Their tag line is: "Your Peers, Your Science. Academic Publishing Is Evolving"</p>

            <p>Jason Hoyt from PeerJ is one of the principle organisers of the event, and PeerJ is generously providing backing for the event.</p>
            
            <!-- Start of When -->
            <h2><a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/"><img src="images/elife_logo_tp.png" alt="eLife" width="100"></a></h2>
            
            <p>eLife is a unique collaboration between funders and practitioners of research to communicate influential discoveries in the life and biomedical sciences in the most effective way.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"><img src="images/AWS_Logo_Web_tp.png" alt="Amazon Web Services" width="100"></a></h2>
            
            <p>Amazon Web Services offers a complete set of infrastructure and application services that enable you to run virtually everything in the cloud: from enterprise applications and big data projects to social games and mobile apps. Both PeerJ and eLife run significant parts of their infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (we think they rock!)</p>

            <p>Amazon Web Services are providing AWS credits for attendees of the event!</p>
